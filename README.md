## Overview and Origin
RobinHood Markets, Inc. is an American financial services company that offers commission-free stock trading, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), exchange traded funds (ETFs), and cryptocurrencies. (Wikipedia) It was founded on April 18th, 2013 by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, who had been college roommates. After college, the pair created trading software for large investment brokerages in New York City. They noted that these Wall Street firms typically charged much more per trade than what it cost them, and had large account minimums.(Robinhood.com) The name Robinhood came from the idea to make investment trading accessible to all, not just the wealthy.(Wikipedia) Robinhood’s initial seed funding round was $3 million dollars. (Crunchbase) The company first launched their app and offered trades in March 2015.

Robinhood filed for its initial public offering (IPO) with the Security and Exchange Commision (SEC) on July 1st, 2021 and offered shares at $38 on July 28th, 2021. They sold 52.4 million shares which initially valued them at $32 billion dollars.(Johnston) Robinhood has raised a total of 6.2 billion dollars over 28 funding rounds. The most recent of these was on May 13th, 2022 in which they raised $648.3 million dollars. (Crunchbase)

## Business Activities
Robinhood Markets, Inc. has a goal of making investment trading accessible to all levels of traders with respect to cash amounts and trading expertise. Their customer market base are mainly millennials, which made up about 80% of their customers in 2015 (Wikipedia). As of April 28, 2022 Robinhood had 22.8 million funded accounts and 15.9 million active users. (AP News) Robinhood appeals to users who value independent control of their trading activities and easy-to-use applications.  

The Company makes their income in three main ways: interest on customer’s cash balances, margin lending, and payment for order flows, for which they have been criticized. (Michaels, Osipovich)

Some main competitors are E-Trade, Webull, Public, and more recently SoFi as they have branched out from solely lending and into investment management apps as well. (Consumer Advocate) Robinhood’s success has been mainly due to its ease of use apps and commission free trades. While E-Trade has a wider range of traditional investments, including index and mutual funds, Robinhood’s cryptocurrency availability keeps them popular with younger investors.(Voigt, Davis) As of Jan 25th, 2023 Robinhood introduced traditional and Roth IRAs that will match contributions up to 1%, which continues to entice workers who are not able to get retirement savings matching through their workplace (Suknanan). 
Robinhood currently uses multiple technologies to create their web-based trading applications, including Python, React, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, Ubuntu, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google analytics. (Stackshare) Their Development and Operations utilizes Git, GitHub, and Slack to integrate seamless working environments. (Stackshare)

## Domain Trends and Landscape
Robinhood Markets, Inc. is a fintech company in the domain of investment management and trading. This area of fintech has been explosive over the last 5 to 10 years. Robinhood was the pioneer of commission free trading, and many other larger companies including E-Trade, TD AmeriTrade and Charles Schwab followed suit not long after Robinhood gained popularity in 2015-2017.(Voigt, Davis) Other investment fintech companies have sprung up after Robinhood as well. Some notable startups are Webull, Public, and Plynk (Consumer Advocate) 

The investment management industry has had many fast-paced changes in recent years. The ease of accessibility to trading has seen a large influx of smaller investors, who have nevertheless had a large impact on the market and volatility trends. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 left many people with nothing to do at home, subsequently Robinhood gained many new participants. When the stock market crashed in March 2020, Robinhood investors bought into the market at its lowest with impeccable timing. (Reinike) Many more well-known investors lamented these Robinhood users for their effect on the stock market, but an August 2020 study by Nick Magguilli and Ritholtz Wealth Management shows “there was little to no correlation between the one-day change in stock price and the one-day change in the number of Robinhood users holding them,” (Fox). Still, Robinhood small investors have been able to effect the stock market through coordinated actions, as in the case of GameStop stock in January 2021. (Kaaru)  Due in large part to Robinhood’s paving the way, today commission free trades are the standard and ease of use for smaller independent investors is a consideration across all major fintech investment firms.

## Results
Robinhood has been a trailblazer from its very inception. The company began by opening up trading and wealth management to people from all walks of life, and has continued to innovate new investing trends and set industry standards along the way. In September 2016, they launched Robinhood Gold, a subscription plan that offers instant deposits, margin lending, and access to more market analytics. (Constine) In December 2017 they introduced options trading. (Wikipedia)
They announced a waitlist for commission free cryptocurrency trading in 2018 that had over 1,250,000 people after the first day. (Wikipedia) In some ways, it seems everything they touch is gold. 

There have been some controversies, however, throughout the company’s turbulent rise to fame. They have received backlash for their payment for order flow practices, which have been proven to not always benefit the customer’s best pricing (Michaels, Osipovich) They also have had issues with outages and security breaches over the years. In 2021 when users attempted to drive up the price of specific stocks, including GameStop, Robinhood restricted trading in these stocks. The move got them an influx of bad reviews, condemnation from many outlets, and multiple lawsuits. (Kaaru) Despite this, Robinhood continues to score well in user experience and low costs, and has a bright future in the fintech industry.

## Recommendations
As a leading innovator in trading and wealth management, Robinhood has always been on the cutting edge between technology and investing. After having expanded their platform to include cryptocurrency trading to all of the United States and the United Kingdom, and reaffirming their hold of traditional trading by offering both traditional and Roth IRAs in 2023 (Suknanan), it’s time to set their eyes on yet another new frontier. My recommendation for Robinhood Markets, Inc. is to begin looking into trading NFTs. 

NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a blockchain based currency that have exploded popularity in 2021-2022. NFT stands for non-fungible token, meaning that these tokens are not interchangeable. Each token represents ownership of a unique item that cannot be easily traded for another. (Clark) Fungible items, like the US dollar, can be interchanged, meaning that trading one dollar for another yields no variance in value. Each dollar is worth the same amount. NFTs are unique tokens of ownership of a specific, non-fungible item. They have so far been used mostly in the ownership of digital art products. The value of NFTs can swing drastically based on the popularity of the item or artist, as seen with celebrities rushing to buy Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs in early 2022. (Clark) With the hype and price tag of some of these NFTs, they have become a status symbol to people who can afford them. They have also been a get-rich-quick scheme for investors, and many actually lost money when their NFT lost popularity. Despite the inherent risk, NFTs are likely here to stay. 

Since Robinhood already trades cryptocurrency, adding NFTs to their business would continue to entice young entrepreneurs and digital collectors alike. This would keep the Company relevant in an ever changing technical landscape. Creating and trading NFTs will require a blockchain programming network. Blockchain is a network system that is decentralized between all the various computer systems, called nodes, of a peer-to-peer network. (Hayes) This would be required in order to store a ledger of payments and transactions transparently. Blockchain allows for the expansion of cryptocurrency and NFTs and will undoubtedly be used in a variety of ways in the future. Currently, there are thousands of projects looking into how to use blockchain to store data points in other industries from education to elections (Hayes). It is clear that Blockchain programming is the future of fintech, and the more that Robinhood can lead the way in blockchain trading, the more success they will have in the future.
